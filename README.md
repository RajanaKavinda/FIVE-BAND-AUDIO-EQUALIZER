# FIVE-BAND-AUDIO-EQUALIZER
This repo contains project files of Five band audio equalizer done as a part of the Laboratory Practice module for semester 3.
In this project, we used audio filters to create a
five-band graphic equalization circuit. To separate the
low, high, and mid-range frequencies of the audio
stream, it contains low, high, and band-pass
filter circuits. Our circuits contain operational
amplifier-based active filters (op-amps) and has
capable of adding gains in 5 frequency bands 
20-300Hz , 300 - 1 kHz, 1kHz - 4 kHz , 4kHz - 10kHz , 10kHz- 20kHz.
